# NGS Gene Differential Expression Analysis


## Data Processing
- Data Cleaning
- Identify which columns are numeric
- Check that the dataframes of treated and control are the same size

## Paired sample t-test

merged in data from  http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/ with p-value 0.1

## Data ViZ
- Barplot for gene ontology enrichment data
- Scatter plot with pandas function
- Barplot for the mean difference differentially expressed genes  (gene control greater than treated)
